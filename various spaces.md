Frechet, Banach and Sobolev. I don't particularly care about their differences.

Start with vector spaces that have a topology. Throw in a family of seminorms for some reason. If it's also complete, i.e. Cauchy sequences converge, it's called Frechet.
In particular all Banach spaces are also Frechet.
