My old nemesis, I still don't understand you.
The unintuitive part is that the definition supposes a measure exists, and I've always had trouble with non-constructive definitions. A thing to get used to.

## Examples

- $R^n$: Lebesgue measure
- $S^1$: arc length
- $G$ discrete: counting measure
- $T^n = (S^1)^n$: product of arc length measures
