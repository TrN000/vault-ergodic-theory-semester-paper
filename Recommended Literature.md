This paper is based on (Zimmer 85[[check]]) so naturally that is a good place to go for a reader familiar with the necessary prerequisites.
I recommend (Kerr 16) for its excellent first chapter "General Framework and Notational conventions", in which the authors go to great lengths to give explicit definitions for everything needed to understand the material.
Furthermore, the Lecture series by Daniel Labardini-Fragoso on Hyperbolic geometry, which can be found on Youtube (the source text was unavailable at time of writing).
This lecture gives a very visual exposition on the material and is a great supplemental material for people unfamiliar with m√∂bius transforms and and their relation to the groups $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ and others.
