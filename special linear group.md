this is what we care about in the paper because that's what Zimmer uses as a base example for everything (as far as possible).

## Reasoning
MÃ¶bius transforms on the upper halfplane -> where special linear group comes from.
-> for a generic group with finite center we can locally take an isomorphism to SLn, which we can then apply the proof to from SL2.
See [[the SL(2, R) part of the proof]] for technical details.
