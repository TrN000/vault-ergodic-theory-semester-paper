from ERFA 2.1.
first go at doing stuff with operators. Shows that any TVS X and group action of G abelian with G-invariant subset has a fixed point. 
We do this by a sort of convergence argument where we pick the intersection of all operators defined by powers of $g \in G$ , namely $\{M_{g,n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_0^{n-1}\pi(g^i) | g \in G, n > 0\}$.
Then by some more argumentation, the invariant part of $TA \neq \emptyset$.

Shows how Operator proofs seem to go. (to be updated)
