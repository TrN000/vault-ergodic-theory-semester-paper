# Measure Spaces
A _measurable space_ is a pair $(X, \mathscr{B})$ where $X$ is a set and $\mathscr{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $X$. Elements of $\mathscr{B}$ are called _measurable sets_. A function of measurable spaces $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is called _measurable_ if $f^{-1}(A)$ is a measurable set in $X$ for all measurable sets $A$ of $Y$.

A _measure_ on a measurable space $(X, \mathscr{B})$ is a map $\mu: \mathscr{B} \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ such that
- $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$, and
- $\mu(\cup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_n)$ for every countable collection $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of pairwise disjoint sets in $\mathscr{B}$ (countable additivity).

[[todo]]: borel measure,
The Borel $\sigma$-algebra of a topological space $X$ is the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{B}$ generated by the
open subsets of $X$ , and the members of $\mathscr{B}$ are called Borel sets (we may also refer to them as measurable sets if we are viewing $(X, \mathscr{B})$ abstractly as a measurable space).
A Borel measure on $X$ is a probability measure on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $X$.

## "direct difference" notation
Zimmer, and we, use the symbol "$\ominus$" to denote "subtraction" of linear subspaces of Hilbert spaces.
If $A \subset B$ are linear subspaces of a Hilbert space, $B \ominus A = \{x \in B: (x,y) = 0 \text{ for all }y \in A\}$.
## Group Actions
By an action of the group $G$ on a set $X$ we mean a map $\alpha: G \times X \rightarrow X$ such that, writing the first argument as a subscript, $\alpha_s(\alpha_t(x)) = \alpha_{st}(x)$ and $\alpha_e(x) = x$ for all
$x \in X$ and $s, t \in G$.
Most of the time we will not give this map a name and write the image of a pair $(s, x)$ written as $sx$, or as $s \cdot x$ if there is a chance of notational confusion.
For sets $A \subset X$ and $K \subset G$ and an $s \in G$ we write
$$
s A = \{sx : x \in A\},
\quad
K x = \{sx : s \in K \},
\quad
K A = \{sx : x \in A \text{ and } s \in K \}.
$$
The _G-orbit_ of a point $x \in X$ is the set $Gx$.

## Definition
\definition{quasi-invariant}
A measure $\mu$ is quasi-invariant under a group action of $G$ if it preserves null sets.
If $A = gA$ then either $\mu(A)=0$ or $\mu(S\setminus A)=0$.
