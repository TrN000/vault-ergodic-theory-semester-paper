2.2.20 Theorem [Howe-Moore 1] [Sherman 1] [Zimmer 2]: Let $G_i, G, \pi$ be as
in Theorem 2.2.19. Then all matrix coefficients vanish at $\infty$, i.e., $f(g) \rightarrow 0$ as $g$ leaves compact subsets of $G$.


## Theorem 2.2.19
2.2.19 Theorem [Moore 1]: Let $G_i$ be connected non-compact simple Lie groups with finite center, $G = \prod G_i$, and suppose $\pi$ is a unitary representation of $G$ so that for each $G_i$, $\pi|G_i$ has no invariant vectors.
If $H \subset G$ is a closed subgroup and $\pi|H$ has non-trivial invariant vectors, then H is compact.
