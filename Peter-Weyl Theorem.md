Lmao, got you. It gets relevant.

I don't currently judge it to be relevant, but it demonstrates the spectral theorem in action.
In particular, how one can decompose relevant Hilbert spaces like $L^2(G) = ker(T^*T)\sum E_\lambda$ for use with representations.

## Matrix Coefficients
See [[Matrix Coefficients]]
Matrix coefficients are dense in both $C^0$ and $L^2$ of $G$.
