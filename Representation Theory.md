At it's origin, the idea of representation theory is to map a group to a vectorspace.
To relieve some ambiguitiy: we take a homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow GL(V)$ to the group of automorphisms of $V$. 
And call it a day? No. that would be too easy. The question "and then what?" presses to the foreground. The opaque answer is that vector spaces are simply easier to study. 

Questions of particular interest to me in the context of the paper are, which types do I need and what are their properties.

Long story short, we care about $SL(n, \mathbb{R})$.
