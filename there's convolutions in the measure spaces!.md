why tho.
Have to build intuition for this stuff, again.
in FA we use them to show $C^{\infty}_c(\Omega)$ is dense in $L^p(\Omega)$. by doing smoothing tricks with convolutions of smooth functions on tiny neighborhoods.

to remember the order of terms in a convolution $(\delta \star f)$ , $\delta$ is applied to $f$ , so $\delta$ is the weird term with $t-x$ as argument.

A bunch of integral inequalities and differential rules. Don't care about any of them. Might have to get used to them. (EOFA p. 11)
