A lattice is a discrete group embedded in a Lie Group, such that the quotient is compact.
In the simplest case, we take $\mathbb{Z}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. This is the ur-example of a lattice.
Lattices that behave like $\mathbb{Z}^n$ are considered _well behaved_, in a sense(TM).

The central structural question of lattices is concerned with how much structure can we transport from the discrete group to the Lie group, and vice versa.

Coming from a Lie group focused background, the second part of that question is slightly more interesting, as we want to reuse our knowledge concerning groups with manifold structure "down" to the discrete case. A priori we can't say much, as the lack of "infinitesimal wiggle room" goes down the drain, but with ergodic theory (some of it, there are other areas [[check]])
