## def: Borel sets
The Borel sets, given a topology $\tau$, are all constructible sets by countable union, intersection and taking complements. It is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra to do so.

It's to make measures work on topological spaces.

A function is borel if the preimage of any open is a Borel set.
