# Change Log

Correction of spelling errors and minor adjustments not mentioned.

## Abstract and Preamble

- fixed names in abstract (2 initials for R.J. Zimmer and C.C. Moore)
- capitalized section titles
- removed mention of density from explanation of ergodicity
- added section and subsection numbering
- set theorems, definition, etc on the same counter

## Introduction

- deleted line that seems to be an editing artefact
- fixed definition of ergodicity to be closer to Zimmer's (and correct)
- removed unnecessary redefinition of ergodicity

## definitions

- changed link style to be more visible
- fixed broken itemize section
- rearranged Borel sets to be defined earlier.
- deleted 4th definition of ergodicity. reducing total number to 2

## direct integral

- put the pseudo code part in a footnote
- did not combine thms 3,4 into 5
- fiddled with theorem styling. I don't think it's an improvement, but now proofs have a square at the end.
- in proof of thm 7 (Zimmer 2.3.6), no clue what to do with comment
