# Change Log

Correction of spelling errors and minor adjustments not mentioned.

## Abstract and Preamble

- fixed names in abstract (2 initials for R.J. Zimmer and C.C. Moore)
- capitalized section titles
- removed mention of density from explanation of ergodicity
- added section and subsection numbering
- set theorems, definition, etc on the same counter

## Introduction

- deleted line that seems to be an editing artefact
- fixed definition of ergodicity to be closer to Zimmer's (and correct)
- removed unnecessary redefinition of ergodicity

## definitions

- changed link style to be more visible
- fixed broken itemize section
- rearranged Borel sets to be defined earlier.
- deleted 4th definition of ergodicity. reducing total number to 2

## direct integral

- put the pseudo code part in a footnote
- did not combine thms 3,4 into 5
- fixed thm 3.7 by requiring a countable G and refered to Zimmer for uncountable proof.
- fiddled with theorem styling. I don't think it's an improvement, but now proofs have a square at the end.
- in proof of thm 7 (Zimmer 2.3.6), no clue what to do with comment

## proving the theorem

- fixed statement of nonsensical lemma 4.1
- fixed theorem refencing. now capitalized, but at least easier to click on.
- deleted unnecessary footnote
- recreated picture with tikz
- "the theorem for SL(2, R)" wasn't a proper theorem environment.
- also found out that the little square isn't printed if \end{proof} is preceeded by an empty line.

## conclusion

- added definition for irreducible G-space
- added an argument motivating the move between thm 2.2.19 to 2.2.15

## appendices

- bibliography fixed itself? unclear why, but it's consistent now
