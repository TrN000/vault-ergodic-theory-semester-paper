(Zimmer 2.2.6)
Theorem: (Moore's Ergodicity Theorem): Let $G = \prod G_i$ be a (finite) product of connected non-compact simple Lie groups with finite center.
Let $\Gamma \subset G$ be an irreducible lattice. If $H \subset G$ is a closed subgroup and $H$ is not compact, then H is ergodic on $G/\Gamma$.

We use the [[Connection between Matrix Coefficients and Ergodicity]] to equate our theorem of interest with this one, of broader interest.
