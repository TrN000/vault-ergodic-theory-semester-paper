In concluding this section, we indicate the modifications necessary in the
above argument for a general semisimple G. Let A c G be a maximal IR-split
torus. Then A c G' c G where G' is semisimple and split over IR, and A is the
maximal IR-split torus of G'. Choose a maximal linearly independent set S of
positive roots of G' relative to A such that for a, {3ES, a+ {3 is not a root. Then
the direct sum of the root spaces is the Lie algebra of an abelian subgroup
B c G', with dim B =dim A, and B is normalized by A. The representations
of AB can be analyzed exactly as in the case of SL(n, IR), and since the relevant
copies of s1(2, IR) are present, we deduce that either we are done, or some
one-dimensional subgroup A 0 c A leaves a non-trivial vector fixed. (Actually
to obtain this we may need to use the universal covering G of SL(2, IR) rather
than SL(2, IR) itself. Namely, we need that for N c SL(2, IR) as in the proof of2.4.2,
N c G the connected component of the lift of N to G (so that N ~ N ), that N
invariant vectors are G-invariant. However, this follows by elementary covering
space arguments applied to the picture in the proof of 2.4.2. If G is algebraic,
which will be our main concern, consideration of SL(2, IR) suffices.) The proof
then proceeds as in the case of SL(n, IR); G is generated by elements that either
commute with Ao or lie in a suitable copy of the group P.
