	abstract = {If ϱ is a unitary representation of a locally compact group
	            G, one is very often interested in the asymptotic behavior of
	            the operators ϱ(g) as g tends to ∞ in G. Put another way one
	            is interested in what operators not in ϱ(G) can be (weak)
	            limits of the ϱ(g) as g tends to ∞. The first part of the
	            paper deals with the question of what kinds of unitary
	            operators can be limits of ϱ(g), and we show that for
	            connected G the possibilities are very limited. The second
	            part of the paper deals with the question of when one can
	            conclude that essentially the only operator of any kind not
	            in ϱ(G) obtained as a limit of the ϱ(g) is 0. This amounts to
	            showing that the matrix coefficients of ϱ “vanish at ∞,” and
	            we establish affirmative results for irreducible
	            representations of connected algebraic groups over local
	            fields (archimedian and non-archimedian). Such results turn
	            out to have applications to the theory of automorphic forms
	            and to ergodic theory.},

	            representation theory of semisimple Lie groups in a way that
	            reflects the spirit of the subject and corresponds to the
	            natural learning process. This book is a model of exposition
	            and an invaluable resource for both graduate students and
	            researchers. Although theorems are always stated precisely,
	            many illustrative examples or classes of examples are given.
	            To support this unique approach, the author includes for the
	            reader a useful 300-item bibliography and an extensive
	            section of notes.},
