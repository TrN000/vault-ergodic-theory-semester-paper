- G-space -> the action map is Borel
- borel function -> preimage of open sets is Borel
- essentially constant
- ergodic -> orbits are null or conull
- "invariant vector" -> $\pi(g)v = v$
- is 2.2.15 not sort of the same but rephrased?
- "boundary action" of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. -> related to mÃ¶bius transforms but idk
- what does $S/G$ mean? -> [[Orbit Space]]
- G-space is still unclear if he means that the measure extends. -> a space with a G-action that agrees with whatever(Borel)-structure we have on that space.
- it is not superficially evident, why countably separated comes into this. -> for Haar measure
- where does the trivial center requirement come from
