- zimmer FA A.29 why is $f(z)=z^n$ an orthonormal basis?
--> it's in $\mathbb{C}$.
- commutativity of repr in some cases? $\langle \pi(g)v, w \rangle = \langle v, \pi^*(g)w \rangle = \langle v, \pi(-g)w\rangle$  ? ERFA 2.2.11
--> assume because $(Av)^\intercal = v^\intercal A^\intercal= v^\intercal A^*$ and then that it's the inverse follows from 'unitary'

- why does conjugation of an inner product move the operator? $\overline{\langle Tx, y \rangle} = \langle x, Ty \rangle$
-> hilbert spaces are conjugate symmetric? not entirely sure this applies here.
